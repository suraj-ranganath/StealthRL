title: "StealthRL: Reinforcement Learning Paraphrase Attacks for Multi-Detector Evasion of AI-Text Detectors"

abstract: >
  We introduce StealthRL, a reinforcement-learning framework that paraphrases
  AI-generated text to evade detection while preserving meaning and fluency,
  enabling systematic red-teaming of AI-text detectors. The challenge is to
  reduce detector confidence at strict low-false-positive operating points
  without collapsing semantic fidelity or overfitting to a single detector
  family. StealthRL fine-tunes a Qwen-family paraphraser with LoRA and a
  multi-objective reward combining detector evasion, semantic similarity, and
  fluency. On the MAGE benchmark with multiple detectors, StealthRL reduces
  detection at stringent operating points while maintaining high semantic
  similarity, outperforming simple paraphrasing and a detector-guided baseline.
  We release an anonymized code package in the supplementary material with a
  placeholder anonymous link for reproducibility.

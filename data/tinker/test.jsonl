In traditional transformers, there exists an upper dependency length limit equal to the length of this context. The Transformer-XL addresses these issues by caching the representations of previous segments to be reused as additional context to future segments, thus increasing the context size and allowing information to flow from one segment to the next. This longer-term dependency capture can be particularly useful when applying transformers to domains outside of natural language.

In this paper, we discuss our attempt to create a robust system for extractive question answering (QA). We use a BERT variant as our baseline, and attempt four methods to improve upon it. Our first method is a model that uses the Mixture-Of-Experts (MoE) technique described in the \"Adaptive Mixtures of Local Experts\" paper and the Robust QA Default Project handout. The second is an original inference-time procedure which predicts the answer span that maximizes the expected F1 score.

{"ai_text": "The first lesson I learned as a student pilot is that left and right don\u2019t exist. Maybe driving on a highway or in a parking lot, left and right is precise enough to describe the location and movements of slow-moving bikers, pedestrians, and cars. But at 36,000 feet in the air in a steel tube hurdling almost 200 miles an hour? Left and right just don\u2019t cut it. During one of my first flights in a small Cessna-182, my flight instructor ordered me to scan the horizon for approaching aircrafts. To my right, I caught a glimpse of one: another Cessna with maroon stripes, the sun\u2019s reflection glinting off its windows. Gesturing vaguely to my two o\u2019clock, I informed my flying instructor, \u201cThere\u2019s a plane to the right.\u201d \u201cNo, to your right. From his position, what direction does he see you?\u201d From his angle, I was to his left. In that moment, I realized that perspective and precision of language is everything. The radio chirped: \u201cCessna One-Eight-Two Sandra, heading north to John Wayne Airport. Over.\u201d I navigate using my compass\u2019s north, east, south, and west directions because every pilot\u2019s vantage point differs from each other both vertically and horizontally, creating opposite perspectives. My right was that pilot\u2019s left. Through flying, I began to consider all points of view, regardless of my personal perspective. Perhaps it was my ability to scan the horizon to communicate a single story, uniting contrasting outlooks, that drew me to my love for journalism and the diverse melting pot that was my community. To me, journalism modernizes the ancient power of storytelling, filled with imperfect characters and intricate conflicts to which I am the narrator. As editor-in-chief for my school newspaper, The Wildcat\u2019s Tale, I aim to share the uncensored perspective of all students and encourage my editorial groups to talk \u2014 and listen \u2014 to those with whom they disagree. Starting each newspaper edition with a socratic, round-table discussion, I ask the other journalists to pursue stories that answer the questions: why did this happen and where will it lead? Expanding beyond the perspectives of my classmates, I began writing articles for the Korea Daily, and later, the Los Angeles Times High School Insider. I schedule interviews with city council candidates, young and old voters, and mayors of my town, obtaining quotes and anecdotes to weave into my writing. My interviews with both Democratic and Republican voters have taught me to thoroughly report polarizing-opposite opinions through an unbiased lens. As a journalist, I realized I cannot presume the opinions of the reader, but instead simply provide them with the tools necessary to formulate their own conclusions.

My favorite stories to publish are the ones taped onto fridges, proudly framed on the mom-and-pop downtown diner, or pinned into the corkboard in my teacher\u2019s classroom. I discovered the size of my story does not matter, but the impact I leave on the reader does. In my time as both a student pilot and journalist, I grew to love these stories, the ones that showed me that living life with blinders, can not only be boring, but dangerous. Whether I was 36,000 feet in the air or on ground level, by flying and writing, I realized that the most interesting stories of life come straight from the people most different from me.", "human_reference": "The first lesson I learned as a student pilot is that left and right don\u2019t exist. Maybe driving on a highway or in a parking lot, left and right is precise enough to describe the location and movements of slow-moving bikers, pedestrians, and cars. But at 36,000 feet in the air in a steel tube hurdling almost 200 miles an hour? Left and right just don\u2019t cut it. During one of my first flights in a small Cessna-182, my flight instructor ordered me to scan the horizon for approaching aircrafts. To my right, I caught a glimpse of one: another Cessna with maroon stripes, the sun\u2019s reflection glinting off its windows. Gesturing vaguely to my two o\u2019clock, I informed my flying instructor, \u201cThere\u2019s a plane to the right.\u201d \u201cNo, to your right. From his position, what direction does he see you?\u201d From his angle, I was to his left. In that moment, I realized that perspective and precision of language is everything. The radio chirped: \u201cCessna One-Eight-Two Sandra, heading north to John Wayne Airport. Over.\u201d I navigate using my compass\u2019s north, east, south, and west directions because every pilot\u2019s vantage point differs from each other both vertically and horizontally, creating opposite perspectives. My right was that pilot\u2019s left. Through flying, I began to consider all points of view, regardless of my personal perspective. Perhaps it was my ability to scan the horizon to communicate a single story, uniting contrasting outlooks, that drew me to my love for journalism and the diverse melting pot that was my community. To me, journalism modernizes the ancient power of storytelling, filled with imperfect characters and intricate conflicts to which I am the narrator. As editor-in-chief for my school newspaper, The Wildcat\u2019s Tale, I aim to share the uncensored perspective of all students and encourage my editorial groups to talk \u2014 and listen \u2014 to those with whom they disagree. Starting each newspaper edition with a socratic, round-table discussion, I ask the other journalists to pursue stories that answer the questions: why did this happen and where will it lead? Expanding beyond the perspectives of my classmates, I began writing articles for the Korea Daily, and later, the Los Angeles Times High School Insider. I schedule interviews with city council candidates, young and old voters, and mayors of my town, obtaining quotes and anecdotes to weave into my writing. My interviews with both Democratic and Republican voters have taught me to thoroughly report polarizing-opposite opinions through an unbiased lens. As a journalist, I realized I cannot presume the opinions of the reader, but instead simply provide them with the tools necessary to formulate their own conclusions. However, differences in perspective in my articles are not solely limited to politics.

All I know about my \u201cfather\u201d is that he didn\u2019t have a familial history of cancer, he has a twin brother who is 6'4\", and he studied math in school. This is all background information; I don\u2019t even know his name. He doesn\u2019t know mine, nor does he know that I even exist. People often ask \u201cWhat does your father do for a living?\u201d and I\u2019m forced to respond \u201cI actually have two moms,\u201d triggering reactions like that of my driving instructor, \u201cOh, well that must be different.\u201d I\u2019m 17-years-old and still don\u2019t know how to respond to these comments. When I was 5, Mary, who had been sick for a long time with leukemia, passed away, and my life was turned upside down. I was old enough to understand grief, and yet I still question why it happened. It was terrifying seeing my mom break down while saying, \u201cMom died last night.\u201d I wonder what I missed out on and carry guilt that I don\u2019t remember much about Mary, because we just didn\u2019t have enough time together. Many say grief gets easier with time, however, I think the way you grieve just changes over time. The world kept spinning and, in 2011, my biological mom met another woman, who soon became my stepmom. However, to me, Kerry is also my mom. No longer do I reveal the fact that I have two moms; now I get reactions to the fact that I have three.

He didn\u2019t console me when I began crying at the dry-erase board at school because it reminded me of white boards Mom wrote on when she was unable to talk. He didn\u2019t teach me that love is love. He didn\u2019t teach me who I was becoming, my moms did that. I\u2019ve never known my father or that I was supposed to have one, so why would I think my life is any different from the so-called \u201cnorm?\u201d If there\u2019s one thing I have learned from my parents, it\u2019s that I have developed a love for difference.

Because they were a same-sex couple, the law required that Mary adopt me in order to be my parent. They used Sperm Donor 3311. All I know about my \u201cfather\u201d is that he didn\u2019t have a familial history of cancer, he has a twin brother who is 6'4\", and he studied math in school. This is all background information; I don\u2019t even know his name. He doesn\u2019t know mine, nor does he know that I even exist. People often ask \u201cWhat does your father do for a living?\u201d and I\u2019m forced to respond \u201cI actually have two moms,\u201d triggering reactions like that of my driving instructor, \u201cOh, well that must be different.\u201d I\u2019m 17-years-old and still don\u2019t know how to respond to these comments. When I was 5, Mary, who had been sick for a long time with leukemia, passed away, and my life was turned upside down. I was old enough to understand grief, and yet I still question why it happened. It was terrifying seeing my mom break down while saying, \u201cMom died last night.\u201d I wonder what I missed out on and carry guilt that I don\u2019t remember much about Mary, because we just didn\u2019t have enough time together. Many say grief gets easier with time, however, I think the way you grieve just changes over time. The world kept spinning and, in 2011, my biological mom met another woman, who soon became my stepmom. However, to me, Kerry is also my mom.

He didn\u2019t console me when I began crying at the dry-erase board at school because it reminded me of white boards Mom wrote on when she was unable to talk. He didn\u2019t teach me that love is love. He didn\u2019t teach me who I was becoming, my moms did that.

{"ai_text": "Title: Improved Robustness in Question-Answering via Multiple Techniques\nAbstract: Question-answering models are one of the most promising research areas in NLP. There has already been much study and development on how to accurately search for the correct answer of unanswered questions when the question is in the training domain. The usage of pretrained language models, such as ELMo, GPT, BERT, etc., enables knowledge gained from pretraining to be transferred to the new model. Although some models might outperform human performance for in-domain data, when it comes to out-of-domain data, they have poor performances. For the real world applications, we want a QA model to be able to both cover various domains and generalizes well on the out-of-domain data, hence the idea of domain generalization is proposed. For most of the current QA models, additional data is required to learn the new domains, and models tend to overfit on specific domains. Since it's impossible for a QA model to train on all domains, it's crucial to apply different techniques to build domain-agnostic QA models that can learn domain-invariant features instead of focusing on the specific features when there's limited training data.\n\nIn this project, we are given three types of in-domain datasets: SQuAD, Natural Questions, NewsQA, and three types of out-of-domain datasets: DuoRC, RACE, RelationExtraction. By reading through papers, we've learned different techniques, such as adversarial training, data augmentation, task-adaptive pretraining, etc., that might help with domain generalization. We first apply them individually on the given baseline model, DistilBERT, compare their F1 and EM scores, and analyze their performances. Then, we apply several combinations of the techniques, and further explore the performances of their combinations.

The usage of pretrained language models, such as ELMo, GPT, BERT, etc., enables knowledge gained from pretraining to be transferred to the new model. Although some models might outperform human performance for in-domain data, when it comes to out-of-domain data, they have poor performances. For the real world applications, we want a QA model to be able to both cover various domains and generalizes well on the out-of-domain data, hence the idea of domain generalization is proposed. For most of the current QA models, additional data is required to learn the new domains, and models tend to overfit on specific domains. Since it's impossible for a QA model to train on all domains, it's crucial to apply different techniques to build domain-agnostic QA models that can learn domain-invariant features instead of focusing on the specific features when there's limited training data.\n\nIn this project, we are given three types of in-domain datasets: SQuAD, Natural Questions, NewsQA, and three types of out-of-domain datasets: DuoRC, RACE, RelationExtraction. By reading through papers, we've learned different techniques, such as adversarial training, data augmentation, task-adaptive pretraining, etc., that might help with domain generalization. We first apply them individually on the given baseline model, DistilBERT, compare their F1 and EM scores, and analyze their performances. Then, we apply several combinations of the techniques, and further explore the performances of their combinations. Eventually, the task-adaptive pretraining model gives us the best result, an increase of 2.46 in F1 score, and an increase of 3.92 in EM score compared to the baseline.", "domain": "academic", "is_esl": false, "metadata": {"id": "cs224n_0138", "source": "CS224N"}}

{"ai_text": "Title: Data Augmentation: Can BERT Do The Work For You?\nAbstract: Data augmentation has been proved effective in analyzing a neural model's robustness and improving it by re-training with augmented data. Because text data's discrete feature space, most data augmentation techniques require querying multiple systems for language knowledge and meticulous augmentation rule design by researchers. This paper aims to explore the effectiveness of an automatic, black-box data augmentation method using language models, bert context rewriter, and to compare it with another augmentation algorithm, token reorderer, which uses Universal Sentence Encoder's semantic knowledge.  Given a baseline question answering model, we employ DistilBERT masked language model (mlm) to rewrite masked context data and evaluate whether re-training with the augmented data can improve the robustness of the baseline model. This augmentation relies on the existing language knowledge learnt by DistilBERT mlm and does not use additional hand-crafted rules. We also explore how different configurations, including masked token percentage and additional mlm fine-tuning, affect our method's effectiveness. Preliminary experiments show that both our methods obtain improved performance on out-of-domain dev set over the baseline and reduce the performance gaps between in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. However, token reorderer's performance is consistently better than bert context rewriter's in both out-of-domain evaluation (+2.9 F1/+2.9 EM versus +1.9 F1/+1.6 EM) and reducing in-domain out-of-domain gaps (-5.3 F1/-4.8 EM versus -1.7 F1/-2.5 EM) and therefore is more effective in improving the baseline model's robustness.", "human_reference": "Title: Data Augmentation: Can BERT Do The Work For You?\nAbstract: Data augmentation has been proved effective in analyzing a neural model's robustness and improving it by re-training with augmented data.

Given a baseline question answering model, we employ DistilBERT masked language model (mlm) to rewrite masked context data and evaluate whether re-training with the augmented data can improve the robustness of the baseline model. This augmentation relies on the existing language knowledge learnt by DistilBERT mlm and does not use additional hand-crafted rules. We also explore how different configurations, including masked token percentage and additional mlm fine-tuning, affect our method's effectiveness. Preliminary experiments show that both our methods obtain improved performance on out-of-domain dev set over the baseline and reduce the performance gaps between in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. However, token reorderer's performance is consistently better than bert context rewriter's in both out-of-domain evaluation (+2.9 F1/+2.9 EM versus +1.9 F1/+1.6 EM) and reducing in-domain out-of-domain gaps (-5.3 F1/-4.8 EM versus -1.7 F1/-2.5 EM) and therefore is more effective in improving the baseline model's robustness.", "domain": "academic", "is_esl": false, "metadata": {"id": "cs224n_0127", "source": "CS224N"}}

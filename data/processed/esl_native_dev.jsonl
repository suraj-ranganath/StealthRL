Lovesick teenagers armed with cheesy posters and grocery store flowers. Because at my school, winter is the harbinger of the Winter Formal Dance. But as girls secretly gossip as to who they wish to ask them and guys muster up the courage to do so, I spend another year resigning myself to not going. Whenever someone finds out that I\u2019m skipping it, they never assume that it\u2019s because I can\u2019t afford to. Which is why I am always asked this same question: \u201cWhy not? What are you too poor? Hahaha!\u201d The only way I can respond is to laugh it off and to make up an excuse. At times like these, however, living in a homogenously wealthy community can get disheartening because of how indelicate the kids here can be. But they aren\u2019t simply mean for the sake of being petty, they just don\u2019t realize how tactless they are being. Especially since the few less fortunate members of my community hide their situation for fear of being labelled as different. And though hiding the fact that we are poor may seem to work, we\u2019re really just avoiding the problem. The problem being that we shouldn\u2019t be made to feel ashamed of being poor. And the only way to fix this problem is to better inform our community about our struggles. If we want change, it has to start with us. We have to stop hiding the fact that we are poor because it isn\u2019t something to be ashamed of. And by learning our stories and our situations, my community will strive for better understanding and work to be more considerate towards those less fortunate than they are. How do I know this? Because it\u2019s already begun. There has been effort by the less fortunate members of my community to share their stories in person and on social media. I was inspired by this movement and confessed to my own friends about why I never got to the dance. And through this process, I found out how wonderful my community is. Because my friends are all so well-off, they\u2019ve never seen money to be important. Something that I myself am guilty of. Since I never had enough, I\u2019d always viewed money as something sacred. Which is why I never learned to be generous.

I am freshly 14 and visiting my father\u2019s homeland for the first time, unfamiliar with the harsh realities that kids half my age already know ironclad. My guide points out the areas where the grass is overgrown and the fruit trees abundant. People and animals alike know to avoid them; someone has learned of landmines the hard way. It shouldn\u2019t surprise me \u2014 the scars of war on this rugged country are omnipresent \u2014 but it is so jarringly different from my life in London that it is nevertheless hard to digest. It also differs from my father\u2019s rosy stories about his childhood in Katyr-Yurt, stories that made me wish to swim carefree in icy rivers, devour handfuls of fresh sour cherries straight from the tree, and see nights dense with stars. I still experience these beauties of place, but my eyes are now open to the less romanticized parts, both enriching and complicating my connection to my family\u2019s past. Suddenly, too, I am made uncomfortably aware of the conflicting layers of my familial identity. It is the Russian of my Muscovite, Jewish mother that I grew up speaking at home. Yet the Chechen children speak in broken Russian, and the grownups who are more fluent in it are not keen to communicate in the enemy\u2019s language. Seeing the ugly scars of war, both physical and psychological, I cannot help but feel like an intruder, ashamed not only of my Russianness but also of my city-boy naivete. Despite this shame, I yearn to discover what it means to be Chechen, to see their home through their eyes, and through this desire, I begin to feel a deep connection all of my own to this beautiful, fraught land. In Moscow, my new awareness of conflicting identities only intensifies, but now on account of the maternal side of my heritage. Relatives there largely see Chechens as terrorists and raise an eyebrow when they hear where I have spent my summer. Babushka\u2019s neighbour, a nurse who witnessed the carnage from the theatre siege in Moscow, turns away disgustedly when she overhears me relate the beauty of the mountains and the notable generosity of the people. Once again, I register the fear and distrust of \u201cthe other\u201d that reigns in the more homogeneous cultures in Russia, making me appreciate the diversity of London all the more. When I return there, I cannot slip back into life as normal as I have done after past summers. I find myself pondering the question of identity and the way people interpret their own past, informed just as much by collective emotion and memory as by fact. The cosmopolitanism of London is just as I remembered it, but the things I loved about it I now see in a new light. I had always revelled in the fact that, despite our differences in heritage, my peers and I had seen each other as the same \u2014 bound together by being Londoners first and foremost. Now I am interested in conversations that I would never have considered previously, wanting not only to share my newfound experiences but also learn about the personal histories of my friends, many of whom, like me, are the children of immigrants to the UK. When did they come to explore and interrogate their own complicated identities? How did these discoveries make them feel? What does it mean to carry the stories, the poetry, and the pain of so many places within them? Questions like these, which were so important for me to answer about myself, also became a powerful place from which to understand more deeply the people around me and the complex world we share.", "source": "CollegeEssay", "is_esl": false}

I do my share of feeding the dogs and mowing the lawn, but growing up in a two hundred and thirty-four-year-old tavern has meant that my experiences and responsibilities go well beyond the usual fare\u2014like when I discovered my cats meowing and leaping at two chimney swifts that had fallen down the fireplace and were frantically circling my room. Once, during a Nor\u2019Easter, I woke up to find that snow was blowing through the seams of the house\u2019s original window panes. I swept up the little, swirling drifts on my bedroom floor, taped up the windows, and went back to bed. It was in times like these that I was just a bit envious of my friends\u2019 newer, weathertight homes, but deep inside, I knew I would not trade sleeping in extra layers in my quirky, old Harvard, Massachusetts home for any other place.        Since my parents bought it as a fixer-upper, I am often recruited to work on projects like glazing windows, spackling sheetrock, and painting rooms. This past summer, I begrudgingly agreed to help repair the mortar joints in the fieldstone foundation of our basement. I hauled an eighty-pound bag of cement and mixed it with water into a peanut butter-like consistency. I grabbed a gob from the wheelbarrow and got to work stuffing it into the deep crevices between the jumble of stones, troweling it smooth and brushing it to create a finished texture. The hours spent working, much of it on my hands and knees, gave me a lot of time for self-reflection. Undisturbed by text messages or buzzing FaceTime requests, I allowed my mind to wander to the far reaches of my imagination in the quiet solitude of the cellar. Sometimes I reflected on what I should have said in a conversation with a friend, thought through an argument around a current political issue, or pondered ways to frame my essays for summer reading assignments.        Working with my hands, I appreciated the art of forming and sculpting the cement into place, realizing that it was just as creative a process as writing, editing and reworking my essays and poems. It was an iterative and tiring process to get it right. Dripping with sweat, the grinding physical effort from having to work quickly before the cement hardened mirrored my exhaustion in a race I had rowed in last year\u2014 although the weather conditions had been very different. At the Head of the Fish Regatta, I had rowed for three miles through the cold, driving rain, facing a fifteen miles-per-hour headwind\u2014feeling as if my arms and legs were on fire\u2014in order to finish.        Good mortaring requires technical precision, speed and strength. I needed to mix the mortar in the correct proportions; work carefully so I did not miss any gaps; and most of all, I needed to persevere, working until the entire wall was repointed. Eventing requires a similar mastery of multiple skills in order to succeed in the three distinct phases of competition. In dressage, my buckskin horse Eli and I needed to work together as one, in calm precision and balance; in show jumping, we needed the focus and technical skills to count strides and launch at the right moment; and in cross-country, we needed the strength and endurance to gallop several miles over fences, across ditches, and through water obstacles.        Whether handling a bucket of wet cement or a green horse, I recognized that having the patience and determination to keep improving despite hardship, tedium or discomfort was essential to reach any mental or physical goal, be it winning a competition, writing an essay or rebuilding a wall.

We had all journeyed to the TD Garden from wherever we were in our lives to see Tom Petty perform. I knew his music because my mother had shared it with me. It meant something to her and it meant something to me. His music meant something different to every person in that room and all those meanings, all infinite number of them, wrapped around the music notes and existed in harmony on that July night. I had to close my eyes. It was as if I could hear the heartbeats of every person in that room, pulsing along with the rhythm of the music. By sharing his music, Tom Petty gave me a striking awareness of 19,580 people that live and feel alongside each other. Tom Petty will live as long as people feel. Lights flashing beyond my eyelids, I could feel what it was like to live more lives than just my own. Tom Petty's art described his life, but it has weaved its way into those of so many others. My own, my mother's then and when she was my age, and all the strangers around me who didn't seem so strange anymore. We all have to go through our own lives and our own challenges, but just because we have our own lessons to learn doesn't mean we are alone. I looked into the smiles of the crowd, the dancing arms and carefree yes, and realised we were all feeling something of our own. But we were feeling it all together. With the shared heart of others, I can travel vertically through time and horizontally through space. I long to make connections and there are no boundaries that limit how this can be done, not even time and not even space. Imagine trying to count how many people have ever been inspired by the Beatles! Music is an honesty that you embrace more than escape. I sit in front of my piano for hours, copying the rhythm of until it feels right. I'll never tire of hearing another tell me how they're feeling without using any words at all and letting it become part of me. You can't hide from your feelings when someone else is telling them to you. And so I have become a curator of feeling. I am always listening, collecting the art of others. I have stared at paintings until they stared back at me. I cry while I watch almost every film, sometimes just because the characters are nice to each other. I'm as moved by the narrative of my old American Girl Doll books as I am by Dickens. It's all swirls of feelings, of lessons from others that mirror those you need to learn yourself. Art embodies empathy and empathy has become too easy to lose touch with. Art is the same world seen from a different heart. I look at characters or creators and think, \"How did you become the way you are?\" I can look at others and think the same thing. And I have the chance the ask them. Tom Petty did not write \"Breakdown\" just for me. Hard Promises comforts more than just me. I cannot live life from just my own perspective. Art exists in everyone. I embrace my hour-long commute to school as a chance to start conversations through the life that flows from my speakers, using old tunes to understand the world through my neighbors as we talk of our favourite colours or the abstract nature of time.

I was afraid but spoke deliberately; fear would not stop me from sharing my first vulnerable poem: \u2026I want my insides\u2014dry, dead wood\u2014to be lit with a match, and no water could ever put me out, no hurricane of sadness, no gentle rainstorm of doubt could stop the heat inside\u2026 When finished, I looked up to see unblinking eyes and tears running down my teacher\u2019s face. In that moment, I became a writer. I recited the poem near the end of my creative writing class my sophomore year. Throughout the class, students focused on one genre, and choosing to stay on the safe path, I focused on fiction, which I had written since I could hold a pencil. Although I admired poetry and the way a poet in a few lines could convey the feelings expressed in 300 pages of a novel, it intimidated me. I feared I did not have the skill to craft with such imagery, detail, and purpose. When a poet in my class shared her work, I was taken aback by her striking metaphors and cryptic imagery. But what shocked me most was that she got her message across. Suddenly, I had an epiphany: writing didn\u2019t have to follow all the rules. A writer could take a feeling and express it through unique images. It\u2019s not about the picture on the page, but what the picture makes the reader feel. With zeal and inspiration, I began to use literary devices and images with purpose. I aimed to convey emotion through images. Most of my writing before told the stories of fictional characters, but in my poem, I channeled all my confusion and stress. I poured my soul onto the page. When I read my poem out load, several changes occurred in me. I freed myself from the fear of taking risks. My poem gave me the courage to transfer to a new school, a decision which continued to build my confidence and creativity. Before, I had always written as a means of escape, as a way to create distractions by hiding in a world that was not my own. But in writing the poem, I confronted my problems and answered questions. Poetry taught me how to be brave, how to get right up to the edge of a cliff and embrace vulnerability and the fear of the fall. I also realized the impact my writing could have on others. Before, I did not enjoy sharing my writing because I created stories for my own amusement and pleasure. Now my eyes are open to the power of words. I do not view a story or poem as an individual experience, but as a unifying tie amongst people. Writing is about observing the world and using my life stories and emotions to help listeners and readers feel less lost and alone. The tears which fell down my teacher\u2019s face and the wide eyes of my peers were not because they had the same experience as me, but because they paralleled the feeling I created with their own life stories. In revealing the deepest parts of myself, the class contemplated their own deeper thoughts. Now I write to examine; now I write to understand; now I write to comfort the chaos. Etching pieces of myself into the grooves and curves of each sentence. I do not expect others to connect with the story but rather connect with the emotion.

We adjust a pre-trained DistilBERT model such that it leverages datasets with large amounts of training data to achieve higher question-answering performance on datasets with very small amounts of available training data using a novel inner- and outer-layer Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach.\n\nPractically, we first connect pre-trained DistilBERT models and an MoE layer in sequence (inner-layer) and train them on all high-availability data and on a single dataset with low data availability. Then we use several of these DistilBERT-MoE models in parallel to predict observations from multiple datasets with low data availability (outer-layer). We find that the noise reduction achieved by training designated DistilBERT-MoE models for different datasets with low data availability yields greater prediction benefits than the (possibly) increased transfer learning effects achieved by training a single DistilBERT-MoE model on all high- and low-availability datasets together. Both our inner-outer-MoE method and a single DistilBERT-MoE model outperform the baseline provided by a finetuned DistilBERT model, suggesting that the mixture of experts approach is a fruitful venue to enabling robust predictions in contexts with few training examples.", "source": "CS224N", "is_esl": false}

The Green Mountains of Vermont stretch out indefinitely, and from my elevated vantage point, I feel as though we are peers, motionless in solidarity. I\u2019ve lost my corporeal form and instead, while watching invisible currents drive white leviathans across the sky, have drifted up into the epistemological stream; completely alone with my questions, diving for answers. But a few months ago, I would have considered this an utter waste of time. Prior to attending Mountain School, my paradigm was substantially limited; opinions, prejudices, and ideas shaped by the testosterone-rich environment of Landon School. I was herded by result-oriented, fast-paced, technologically-reliant parameters towards psychology and neuroscience (the NIH, a mere 2.11 mile run from my school, is like a beacon on a hill). I was taught that one\u2019s paramount accomplishment should be specialization. Subconsciously I knew this was not who I wanted to be and seized the chance to apply to the Mountain School. Upon my arrival, though, I immediately felt I did not belong. I found the general atmosphere of hunky-dory acceptance foreign and incredibly unnerving. So, rather than engage, I retreated to what was most comfortable: sports and work. In the second week, the perfect aggregate of the two, a Broomball tournament, was set to occur. Though I had never played before, I had a distinct vision for it, so decided to organize it. That night, the glow-in-the-dark ball skittered across the ice. My opponent and I, brooms in hand, charged forward. We collided and I banana-peeled, my head taking the brunt of the impact. Stubborn as I was, even with a concussion, I wanted to remain in class and do everything my peers did, but my healing brain protested. My teachers didn\u2019t quite know what to do with me, so, no longer confined to a classroom if I didn\u2019t want to be, I was in limbo. I began wandering around campus with no company except my thoughts. Occasionally, Zora, my English teacher\u2019s dog, would tag along and we\u2019d walk for miles in each other's silent company. Other times, I found myself pruning the orchard, feeding the school\u2019s wood furnaces, or my new favorite activity, splitting wood. Throughout those days, I created a new-found sense of home in my head. However, thinking on my own wasn\u2019t enough; I needed more perspectives. I organized raucous late-night discussions about everything from medieval war machines to political theory and randomly challenged my friends to \u201csay something outrageous and defend it.\u201d And whether we achieve profundity or not, I find myself enjoying the act of discourse itself. As Thoreau writes, \u201cLet the daily tide leave some deposit on these pages, as it leaves, the waves may cast up pearls.\u201d I have always loved ideas, but now understand what it means to ride their waves, to let them breathe and become something other than just answers to immediate problems. I am most enamored by ideas that cultivate ingenious and practical enrichments for humanity. I enjoy picking some conundrum, large or small, and puzzling out a solution. Returning from a cross country meet recently, my friend and I, serendipitously, designed a socially responsible disposable water bottle completely on accident. Now we hope to create it. I am still interested in psychology and neuroscience, but also desire to incorporate contemplative thought into this work, analyzing enigmas from many different perspectives. My internships at the NIH and the National Hospital for Neuroscience and Neurosurgery in London have offered me valuable exposure to research and medicine.

One of the most difficult areas for current models is generalization. While humans can easily generalize beyond a training data set, computers often have difficulty developing non-superficial correlations beyond the provided data. In this project, we tackled this concept of computer generalization through the development of a robust question answering (QA) system that is able to generalize answers to questions from out-of-domain (OOD) input. Here, we applied a modified Mixture of Experts (MoE) model, where gating and expert training are handled seperately, over the 6 datasets in order to create robustness through specialization of the various expert models. We also applied few-sample fine-tuning to large and small components of the model to try to better account and generalize for cases where there is little data. Ultimately, from the results of the model, we observed that this modified MoE architecture has several limitations through its expert and training method and was unable to improve significantly on the baseline of the model. In addition, we also observed that the few-sample fine-tuning techniques greatly improved the performance of the small, out-of-domain expert but barely improved, and sometimes harmed, models with a larger dataset. As a whole, this paper illustrates the potential limitations of applying a simple MoE model and few-sample fine-tuning to the complex task of generalization and may suggest the implementation of more advanced structures and techniques are necessary for strong performance.", "source": "CS224N", "is_esl": false}

{"id": "toefl_0066", "text": "I think it's better for students to have young teachers even if they're a little bit inexperienced. First of all, young teachers can relate more to their students.  They simply have a lot more in common with them in terms of personal interests and pop culture awareness.  As a result, it's easier for them to connect the classroom material to the real lives of the students.  This can encourage kids to stay motivated and keep on task for their whole school day. Secondly, younger teachers have a lot more energy.  Class sizes are huge now.  In fact, they're probably bigger than ever before.  This can create trouble for older teachers who might run out of energy and not be able to finish their lessons if they have a huge group of students.", "source": "TOEFL11", "is_esl": true}
{"id": "college_0060", "text": "I am a dancer. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve only learned recently, but it\u2019s my reality. My story is not one of the typical dancer: I was not the student who couldn\u2019t sit still or pay attention in class, only to find focus and expression through movement. That just isn\u2019t my story. I\u2019ve always been able to sit still, stay engaged, and absorb what my teachers threw at me: I was a \u201cgood student\u201d. I would sit at my desk, listen and learn, then go home and do my homework. But, the entire time I embodied that \u201cgood student\u201d, I felt like something was missing. It wasn\u2019t physical health\u2014I stayed active and had a healthy diet. But, there was a disconnect between my mind and body. For the longest time, I felt like I lived from the neck up. I love to learn \u2014I always have\u2014but before dance, I was only focused on learning with my head. At the beginning of my junior year I picked up dance. It started on a bit of a whim: I liked watching and I thought learning some moves would help me impress girls. So, I grabbed a like-minded friend and started attending classes. Once I began, I was surprised by how much I liked it. I had discovered something in it that I hadn\u2019t been expecting; I found that I was learning with my entire body. Not to mention that at the same time, I was learning about my body itself\u2014how it worked and moved, every little muscle and bone. My friend eventually quit, but I kept attending class, and began to add more and more classes to my schedule. I dove deep into dance and took every opportunity that I could find to learn. Dancing was like returning to my childhood, like learning to take those first steps. I was learning how my body moved, how to challenge and develop it, and how to interact with other people through a new language. It challenged me in a completely new way and I\u2019ve loved every second of it. Dance has changed my life. Through it, I\u2019ve met people who challenge my beliefs about how the world works and how we all learn. It\u2019s shown me many different paths and ways to navigate through life. I\u2019ve found role models in my teachers who engage me mentally and physically and push me to grow; teachers who I am lucky enough to also call my friends. I\u2019ve found a global and local community of hardworking, intelligent, and skilled people who are always hungry to learn; a community where everyone is accepted, because dance transcends everything\u2014race, class, gender, religion, even language. And for the first time, I\u2019ve found a community where I am fully supported and accepted; a feeling, it seems, that I had never experienced before. Through all of this, I have found a part of my identity and I am proud to call myself a dancer because of it.", "source": "CollegeEssay", "is_esl": false}

To enhance the task performance, we explored two kinds of models. One is baseline BiDAF model, we modified the baseline by adding character embeddings and implementing Co-Attention layers. We conducted the experiments thoroughly to evaluate the effects of each component. The other is QANet, which is a Transformer-based model, only including convolutional and self-attention layers and free of RNN component. We implemented the model from scratch and got some results during the experiments. We found our best result is from the BiDAF-related model and achieved F1 score 64.96, EM score 61.70 in validation set and F1 score 64.712, EM score 60.997 in test set.", "source": "CS224N", "is_esl": false}

We then first trained the model on in-domain datasets and called it the second-phase continued pre-training. After using NewsQA for third-phase continued pre-training, we used data augmented with synonym and antonym replacement to perform the fourth-phase pre-training.

Unacceptable insults are thrown, degrees and qualifications are questioned, I think even a piece of my grandmother's famously flakey parantha whizzes past my ear. Everyone is too lazy to take out a dictionary (or even their phones) to look it up, so we just hash it out. And then, I am crowned the victor, a true success in the Merchant household. But it is fleeting, as the small, glossy, plastic tiles, perfectly connected to form my winning word, are snatched out from under me and thrown in a pile with all the disgraced, \u201cunwinning\u201d tiles as we mix for our next game of Bananagrams. It's a similar donnybrook, this time ending with my father arguing that it is okay to use \u201cRambo\u201d as a word (it totally is not). Words and communicating have always been of tremendous importance in my life: from silly games like Bananagrams and our road-trip favorite \u201cword game,\u201d to stunted communication between opposing grandparents, each speaking a different Indian language; from trying to understand the cheesemonger behind the counter with a deep southern drawl (I just want some Camembert!), to shaping a script to make people laugh. Words are moving and changing; they have influence and substance. Words, as I like them, create powerful flavor combinations in a recipe or (hopefully) powerful guffaws from a stand-up joke. They make people laugh with unexpected storylines at an improv show and make people cry with mouthwatering descriptions of crisp green beans lathered with potently salty and delightfully creamy fish sauce vinaigrette at Girl and the Goat. Words create everything I love (except maybe my dog and my mom, but you know, the ideas). The thought that something this small, a word, can combine to create a huge concept, just like each small reaction that makes up different biogeochemical cycles (it's a stretch, I know), is truly amazing. After those aggressive games, my family is quickly able to, in the words of a fellow Nashvillian, \u201cshake it off.\u201d We gather around bowls of my grandmother's steaming rice and cumin-spiced chicken (food is always, always at the center of it), and enjoy.

{"id": "college_0056", "text": "I\u2019ve spent most of my life as an anti-vegetable carboholic. For years, processed snack foods ruled the kitchen kingdom of my household and animal products outnumbered plant-based offerings. My transformation began with my mom\u2019s cancer diagnosis. My mom went on a 100% whole food plant-based diet. I fully embraced this new eating philosophy to show my support. Eager to figure out the whole \u201cvegan\u201d thing, the two of us started binge-watching health documentaries such as \u201cWhat the Health\u201d and \u201cForks Over Knives\u201d. We read all the books by the featured doctors like \u201cThe China Study\u201d and \u201cHow Not To Die\u201d. I became entranced by the world of nutritional science and how certain foods could help prevent cancer or boost metabolism. Each new food I discovered gave me an education on the role diet plays on health. I learned that, by eating sweet potatoes and brown rice, you could cure acne and heart disease. I discovered eating leafy greens with citrus fruits could boost iron absorption rates. I loved pairing my foods to create the perfect macronutrient balance. Did you know beans and rice make a complete protein? Food has also turned me into a sustainability nut. Living plant-based also saves the planet from the impact of animal agriculture. For the same amount of land space, a farmer can produce 200 kilograms of soybeans versus 16 kilograms of beef. I do my part to have as small of an ecological footprint as I can. I stopped using plastic snack bags and instead turned to reusable beeswax wraps. My favorite reusable appliance is my foldable straw. If I am going to nourish my body, shouldn\u2019t I also want to nourish the earth? My journey toward healthy living led me to becoming co-leader of the Northern Nevada PlantPure Pod, \u201cBiggest Little Plant Pod\u201d, a group dedicated to spreading the message about the whole food plant-based lifestyle. We are currently working on a restaurant campaign to encourage local eateries to create a plant-based, oil-free menu option and become PlantPure certified. After discovering how many restaurants use oil in their cooking, I decided I needed to open a plant-based oil free cafe to make up for this gap. My dream is to open up my very own affordable oatmeal cafe based on my Instagram page, morning_mOATivations. And I know that oatmeal isn\u2019t the sexiest superfood out there, so here\u2019s my sales pitch: I\u2019m going to make oatmeal the Beyonce of the breakfast world- sweet, sassy, and power packed. This allows me to educate people about nutritional science through the stomach. Finally, I am a strong proponent of hands-on experience for learning what good food looks and tastes like, so cooking is one of my favorite ways to teach the benefits of a plant-based lifestyle. Using my taste buds as my textbook to learn which flavors work together and which ones don\u2019t helps me educate, as I\u2019ve found that information tends to stick in a person\u2019s mind once they\u2019ve experienced healthy, delicious foods with their own senses. Our society has taught us that delicious food has to make us feel guilty, when that is simply not the case. The best feeling in the world is falling in love with a dish and then learning all the health benefits that it provides the body. While my classmates complain about being tired, I have more energy because my body is finally getting the right macros, vitamins, and minerals it needs. This has allowed me to push myself harder physically, excelling in running and earning my high school Cross Country team\u2019s Most Improved award. I\u2019m still a picky eater. But the foods I am particular about have changed. Rather than a carboholic, I choose to call myself a vegeholic.", "source": "CollegeEssay", "is_esl": false}
